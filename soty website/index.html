                <br>
                
                <h2>Below are a few episodes of 106 picks, all produced by me and edited by my good friend Brodee Riley.</h2>
                
                

                <p>This is one of the the best episodes of 106 picks, this episode stars me and is focused on cover songs from throughout the years.</p>

                <p>One of the goals of 106 picks was to bring all of the seniors favorite songs together, to make our music selection closer to them. This episode stars Ella Beth Hansing where she talks about her favorite songs.</p>

                <h2>Radio Website</h2>
                <p>In sophomore year, I was tasked to build a website for my coding class. I decided that the subject of the website should be Tiger Radio. The website went on to win the DevCatalyst best website award. As a prize, I won a brand new Macbook Pro. Below is a link to the website as it was in 2020. (Please note not all information is accurate after 2 years).</p>
