# radio_website
Alright now... This website may in fact be the pinacle of every single website known to man. It has everything, style, function, and its just downright amazing. This website was the culmination of Eli Rainey, Ashton Thomas, and Desmond Maw. All of which are masters of the ancient languages of HTML and CSS. And Eli is decent and JavaScript. Together these three sophomores came together to create a website for the greatest club at their school... Tiger Radio. So they worked, and worked, often not looking up from their computer screens until they heard the chimes of the bell. But after about a month and a half, it was complete. The website had everything, information, sponsorship info, a YouTube plug, and archives of old Tiger Radio stories that all aired on the station. It truly is spectacular. And I am truly proud of it (btw we're from Hardin County High School)
